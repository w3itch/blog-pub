Dream Diary) is an adventure game by pseudonymous Japanese developer Kikiyama. The player explore the dreams of the protagonist Madotsuki and encounter a number of surrealistic locations and creatures. The game was created using RPG Maker 2003, but lacks most elements commonly associated with role-playing games such as combat and quests. The game’s primary objective is to collect items known as “effects” that grant Madotsuki new abilities and allow the player to progress to new areas, with the game ending after 24 of them have been collected.</p>\n<p>The reception of the games are polarized. For those encountering Yume Nikki for their first time, the gameplay looks weird. The map and music filled with circulation, and the light is very dim in most cases. You could collect some items, but the vast majority of them are meaningless. This sense of emptiness builds the entire experience of the game, making you feel, at most moments in the game, that everything you do in the game is meaningless. But it is this sense of emptiness that is the most important experience in the entire game narrative, it creates a unique aesthetic that is hardly reconstruct by any other art form. (Perhaps in terms of the game experience, the most similar game before Yume Nikki is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain\">Serial Experiments Lain</a>, there is  even a doujin video called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgiBRyn9UMs\">Yume Nikki Lain OP</a>.)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://storageapi.fleek.co/casimir-crystal-team-bucket/155c7924-e9b7-46fc-9991-5a1bade9d261\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Like <a href=\"https://rpgmakerhistoria.home.blog/2021/12/05/a-history-on-rpg-maker-earthbound-likes-and-fan-games-part-one/\">Earthbound</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zptti2kJpk&amp;ab_channel=aDrive\">Pokemonn</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Touhou_Project_fangames\">Touhou Project</a>, Yume Nikki also has their own fan games community.
